## Introduction of Myself _I Guess_??

I'm a Chung-ang University stutudent currently learning Applied Statistics.
It's ___pretty dang hard___!!!!!

Here are some points that I think why it is hard:
1. I'm not a math person, but you better like math(at least be good at math), or you are gonna suffer like me... __gg__
2. I guess that's about it, honestly. Other than that, it's pretty fun.

So here some random quoate that I found Online just to practice my quoatation.

And here some random(my favorite) picture from the Internet
